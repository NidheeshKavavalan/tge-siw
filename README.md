## About

This repository contains several sketches for playful storytelling with the help of browser windows.

### Usage

Currently this is made for the Chrome Browser under macOs. Because of security reasons Chrome prevents loading of local files from other scripts (which the less compiler does). There is a way [around](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18586921/how-to-launch-html-using-chrome-at-allow-file-access-from-files-mode) using a special Chrome mode.

  1. first close your Chrome browser
  2. open `START.app`
  3. open your `index.html`
